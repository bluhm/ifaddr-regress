Test adding and deleting addreses on a network interface.  Especially
check the cloning, cloned, local, broadcast routes.  Also use aliases
with unusual netmasks.

SUDO has to be set to sudo or doas if the test is started by a
non-root user.

FAKE_ETHER must contain a pseudo ether device that can be created
and destroyed on the system.

FAKE_PREFIX must be a /24 IPv4 prefix that does not exist on the
system.  Addresses and routes in this range are added and deleted.

EXAMPLE

- My environment when executing the test

FAKE_ETHER=vether188
FAKE_PREFIX=10.188.70

export FAKE_ETHER FAKE_PREFIX
